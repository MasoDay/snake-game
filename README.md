Snake game designed in retro Nokia style

Deployed on Azure in Resource Group "My-First_Azure-App" at https://retro-snake-game.azurewebsites.net/.
Similar to Netlify in terms of the process, but with far more configuration options. Pretty cool!
Ran into several issues with US instances not having quota for an app on my subscription. So I played around with changing regions until seeing Brazil South worked.
Azure has a lot of built-in features that make it easy to deploy and manage web applications, I look forward to playing around with them.
Will record a video next time.
